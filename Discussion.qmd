Interpretation of Results: The diversity of Alpha-Proteobacteria and their correlation with nitrogen levels suggest that these microbes play a significant role in nitrogen cycling within the wetland, potentially affecting overall ecosystem health. Implications for Wetland Management: Understanding these relationships helps predict the impacts of nutrient loading on microbial communities and can guide conservation efforts. Study Limitations: The study is limited by its reliance on a single season of data, which may not capture seasonal variations in microbial activity.
